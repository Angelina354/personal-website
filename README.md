## Cloned from [starter-hugo-academic](https://github.com/wowchemy/starter-hugo-academic)

Will be deplyed after customizing!


First steps to run the website locally (after 3 hours of trial & error :cold\_sweat:):
1. Clone the template repo
2. Download [hugo release](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases) and untar it in the folder
    
    *Caution: choose the `extented` version, otherwise it might not work!*
    
3. Set up correct website baseURL at `config/_default/config.yaml`

    *Caution: rendering would not appear if this URL is different from where you access this site on browsers*

4. Run `./hugo` to generate a `./public` folder
5. Access `public` to folder -- you will see your website running!
